This is my third project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. During this project we were able to use the MERN stack to create an application. This means that I used: MongoDB with Mongoose, Express, React and Node.js.

## App Link

## About This Project
* I developed an app that allows users to create grocery list for specific stores and reasons. This app gives the user to create, show, edit and update a user profile. It also gives the users the ability to create and delete both lists and the items they contain.

* In Version 2, I would like to:
..* Pull in a third-party API that has items with pictures and allows users to search for those items as opposed to typing them in.
..* Have aisle numbers displays so that the customer can navigate through the store with ease.
..* Toggle a create user button onClick for the Login Button.
..* Pull in a third-party API for information for each specific store.
..* Make the app mobile first.

# checkList
This is my third project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. During this project we were able to use the MERN stack to create an application. This means that I used: MongoDB with Mongoose, Express, React and Node.js.

## About This Project
* I developed an app that allows users to create grocery list for specific stores and reasons. This app gives the user to create, show, edit and update a user profile. It also gives the users the ability to create and delete both lists and the items they contain.

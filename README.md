# checkList
This is my third project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. During this project we were able to use the MERN stack to create an application. This means that I used: MongoDB with Mongoose, Express, React and Node.js.

## About This Project
* [Click Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/atl-wdi/wdi-curriculum/blob/master/projects/unit_03/README.md) for more information about the scope of this project.

* I developed an app that allows users to create grocery list for specific stores and reasons. This app gives the user to create, show, edit and update a user profile. It also gives the users the ability to create and delete both lists and the items they contain.

* In Version 2, I would like to:
..* Pull in a third-party API that has items with pictures and allows users to search for those items as opposed to typing them in.
..* Have aisle numbers displays so that the customer can navigate through the store with ease.
..* Toggle a create user button onClick for the Login Button.
..* Pull in a third-party API for information for each specific store.
..* Make the app mobile first.
